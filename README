# Simple backup creation and maintaining solution

**Backy** is a simple and open-source solution for creating and maintaining backups of a folder or an entire drive. It's very easy to learn to work with and it is suitable for both Linux(R) and Windows(R) operating systems.

## Get

The first release of Backy has just been released. For the moment only a 64-bit Windows(R) installer is available for download from  [the project's site](https://felsocim.github.io/Backy). We are working on Linux(R) packages as well :-)

## Build

Meanwhile Linux(R) users can build Backy from sources by themselves. Backy uses **qmake** build system to generate the makefile. Thus, you'll have to install it as well as the Qt(R) library if you don't have it already.

## Usage

Backy's graphical user interface is very intuitive notable for beginner users. You can visit the [project's site](https://felsocim.github.io/Backy) to get more information about how to use Backy. 

The technical documentation generated by Doxygen is available at: [https://felsocim.github.io/Backy/technical/html/index.html](https://felsocim.github.io/Backy/technical/html/index.html).

## Localization

As of this day, Backy is localized in US English, French and Slovak. More translations may be added in the future.
